Does your guild enforce a sales quota? Use [URL="http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info928-MasterMerchant.html"]Master Merchant[/URL] to see top sellers? If so, you can do all this from within Master Merchant and do not need this add-on.

But if you also want to record sales to a spreadsheet, that's where this add-on comes in.

This add-on scans Master Merchant sales history, summarizes gold totals for your guild's sellers and buyers over last week, then writes that to a SavedVariables file. It can then convert that SavedVariables file to a comma-separated-value file suitable for import into a spreadsheet.

Column list:
[LIST]
[*]guild name
[*]week ending on date
[*]player account @name
[*]sold: gold earned in the guild trader last week
[*]bought: gold spent in the guild trader last week
[*]is a guild member? Many buyers aren't members.
[/LIST]

Instructions:

[LIST=1]
[*]Click "Save Data Now" button. Add-on will scan Master Merchant and guild membership lists.
[*]Log out (or relog). ESO will then save data, writing SavedVariables/GuildSalesQuota.lua.
[*]From a terminal window, run
[FONT="Courier New"]% cd ~/Documents/Elder Scrolls Online/live/AddOns/GuildSalesQuota
% lua GuildSalesQuota_to_csv.lua
[/FONT] (Or drag and drop [FONT="Courier New"]GuildSalesQuota_to_csv.lua[/FONT] onto [FONT="Courier New"]lua52.exe[/FONT]) This creates [FONT="Courier New"]SavedVariables/GuildSalesQuota.csv[/FONT]
[*]Import GuildSalesQuota.csv into a spreadsheet.
[/LIST]

[FONT="Courier New"]GuildSalesQuota_to_csv.lua[/FONT] requires that you have downloaded and installed a standalone Lua interpreter, presumably from [URL="http://www.lua.org/"]lua.org[/URL].
