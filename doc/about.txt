Does you guild have a sales quota? Which members have sold something through your trader and which have not?

This add-on scans your Master Merchant sales history and summarizes each seller's and buyer's sales for this and last week. This add-on then saves all sales records a SavedVariables file. It can then convert that SavedVariables file to a CSV comma-separated-value file suitable for import into a spreadsheet. It also fetches your guild membership list from the ESO server so that you can find members who lack recent sales.
