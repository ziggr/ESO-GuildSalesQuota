Does your guild enforce a sales quota? Use [URL="http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info928-MasterMerchant.html"]Master Merchant[/URL] to see top sellers? If so, you can do all this from within Master Merchant and do not need this add-on.

But if you also want to record sales to a spreadsheet, that's where this add-on comes in.

This add-on scans Master Merchant sales history, summarizes gold totals for your guild's sellers and buyers over last week, then writes that to a SavedVariables file. It can then convert that SavedVariables file to a comma-separated-value file suitable for import into a spreadsheet.

Optional: integrates with [URL="http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info910-ShissusGuildTools.html"]Shissu's Guild Tools[/URL] to fetch each member's join date. This is to help guildmasters give new members a bit of a grace period before enforcing sales quotas.

Column list:

[*]guild name
